# Simple Terminal Sand Simulator

A terminal-based sand simulator inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868&t=757s).  
I didn’t even watch the whole thing—just two minutes in and thought, *"I could do that."*  
This project exists simply because I felt like making it, and I’m writing this to remember **why** I started.

- I've watched the video this isn't even close to what the video show.
